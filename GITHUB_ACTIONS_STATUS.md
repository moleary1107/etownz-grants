# GitHub Actions Deployment Status

## 🔄 Current Status: IN PROGRESS

The automated deployment via GitHub Actions is currently running. This is a good sign that your SSH key is properly configured!

### 📊 Deployment Pipeline Steps:

1. **Checkout Code** ✅
2. **Install doctl** ✅ 
3. **Build Docker Images** 🔄 (In Progress - takes 5-10 minutes)
   - Backend image
   - Frontend image
   - Crawler image
4. **Login to DigitalOcean Registry** ⏳
5. **Push Images to Registry** ⏳
6. **Deploy to Server via SSH** ⏳

### 🔍 How to Check Progress:

1. **Live Logs**: https://github.com/moleary1107/etownz-grants/actions
2. Click on "Simple Deploy to Production"
3. Click on the running workflow to see detailed logs

### ⏱️ Expected Timeline:

- **Total Time**: 10-15 minutes
- Building images: 5-10 minutes
- Pushing to registry: 2-3 minutes
- Deployment: 1-2 minutes

### 🚨 If Deployment Fails:

Check which step failed:

1. **Build Failed**:
   - Usually due to the login redirect fix we just made
   - Already fixed by removing conflicting page.tsx

2. **Registry Push Failed**:
   - Check DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN is set correctly
   - Token needs registry write permissions

3. **SSH Deploy Failed**:
   - SERVER_SSH_KEY format issue
   - SERVER_IP not set to 165.227.149.136

### ✅ Current Production Status:

While waiting for deployment:
- **Production is still running** the previous version
- All services are operational
- No downtime during deployment

### 📝 Manual Deployment Alternative:

If you need to deploy immediately:
```bash
ssh root@165.227.149.136 'cd /root/etownz-grants && git pull && ./deploy.sh'
```

### 🎯 Expected Result:

Once complete, production will have:
- Latest code (commit: fed986c)
- Login redirect working (/login → /auth/login)
- All previous fixes maintained
