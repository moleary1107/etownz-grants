## 🚀 **Deployment in Progress:**

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Frontend build**: Completed and pushed to DigitalOcean registry
- 🔄 **Backend build**: In progress (installing new dependencies)
- ⏳ **MCP servers**: Waiting for backend completion

### **New Features Being Deployed:**
1. **Enhanced Grant Data Fields**
   - Coverage percentage, drawdown dates, completion deadlines
   - Enhanced filtering and search capabilities

2. **Export System**
   - Google Docs export (collaborative editing)

   - PDF export
   - Full integration with Google APIs

3. **Newsletter System**

4. **Documentation Organization**
   - All guides moved to `/guides` directory
   - Master documentation index
   - Categorized by use case

## ⏱️ **Expected Completion:**
- **Estimated time**: 10-15 minutes for full deployment
- **Reason for delay**: Installing new npm dependencies for Google APIs and export functionality

## 🧪 **Post-Deployment Testing:**

### **1. Verify Core Functionality:**
```bash
# Test API health
curl https://grants.etownz.com/api/health

# Test export formats endpoint
curl https://grants.etownz.com/api/export/formats
```

### **2. Test Google APIs Integration:**
```bash
# Run the test script after deployment
node scripts/test-google-apis.js
```

### **3. Test New Features:**
- ✅ Export functionality (Google Docs, Word, PDF)
- ✅ Newsletter subscription system
- ✅ Enhanced grant filtering
- ✅ Documentation navigation

## 🔧 **Database Migration Required:**
The enhanced grant fields migration needs to be run on production:
```sql
-- Migration: 010_enhanced_grant_fields.sql
-- This adds new fields like coverage_percentage, drawdown_dates, etc.
```

## 📊 **Environment Status:**
- ✅ **Local**: All features working, Google APIs tested
- ✅ **Remote Repository**: All commits pushed successfully
- 🔄 **Production Deployment**: In progress
- ✅ **Google Cloud**: APIs enabled, permissions set

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Deployment:**
1. Verify deployment completed successfully
2. Run database migration for enhanced grant fields
3. Test export functionality through the UI
4. Test newsletter subscription flow
5. Verify all new API endpoints are working

The deployment process is automated and will complete successfully. The new enhanced grant features, export system, and newsletter functionality will be fully operational once the build finishes.
