## üöÄ AI-Assisted Grant Writing Workflows

### 1. Grant Discovery and Analysis

**Ask Claude:**
```
"Use the fetch server to scrape the latest grants from Enterprise Ireland's website and analyze them for my tech startup."
```

**Claude will:**
- Fetch grant opportunity pages
- Extract structured data
- Analyze eligibility and requirements  
- Provide recommendations based on your organization profile

### 2. Document Processing and Analysis

**Ask Claude:**
```
"Process this PDF grant document I uploaded and create an interactive HTML view with all requirements highlighted."
```

**Claude will:**
- Convert PDF to structured JSON
- Extract requirements, deadlines, and eligibility criteria
- Generate interactive HTML for easy review
- Provide AI analysis of difficulty and success factors

### 3. AI Voice Simulation for Applications

**Ask Claude:**
```
"Analyze my previous successful grant applications and help me write a new application in my organization's voice for the SFI Discover Programme."
```

**Claude will:**
- Analyze your writing style from previous documents
- Learn your organization's tone and approach
- Generate application content matching your voice
- Ensure alignment with grant requirements

### 4. Lessons Learned from Failed Applications

**Ask Claude:**
```
"Analyze our rejected application for the EPA Research Grant and extract lessons learned for future applications."
```

**Claude will:**
- Process the failed application document
- Identify weak sections and missing requirements
- Generate improvement recommendations
- Create prevention measures for future applications

## üîÑ Automated Workflows

### Daily Grant Discovery
Set up automated prompts:
```
"Check for new grants in our target categories (technology, research, innovation) and notify me of any high-match opportunities."
```

### Application Quality Checks
Before submission:
```
"Review this draft application against the grant requirements and our success patterns. Provide a quality score and improvement suggestions."
```

### Deadline Monitoring
Weekly reviews:
```
"Review all active grant deadlines and application statuses. Alert me to any upcoming deadlines or required actions."
```

## üéõÔ∏è Advanced Features

### 1. Multi-Organization Support
```json
{
  "organization_profiles": {
    "tech_startup": {
      "sector": "technology",
      "size": "11-50",
      "focus_areas": ["AI", "healthcare", "sustainability"],
      "writing_style": "technical, innovative, data-driven"
    },
    "research_institute": {
      "sector": "research",
      "size": "51-200", 
      "focus_areas": ["renewable energy", "materials science"],
      "writing_style": "academic, detailed, evidence-based"
    }
  }
}
```

## üîê Security and Privacy

### Data Protection
- All document processing happens locally
- No sensitive data sent to external APIs without explicit consent
- User documents remain within your infrastructure
- AI analysis uses only metadata and anonymized content patterns

### API Key Management
- Store OpenAI keys securely in environment variables
- Use separate keys for different environments
- Rotate keys regularly for security

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**MCP Server Not Found:**
```bash
# Check if servers are running
docker-compose ps

# Restart specific server
docker-compose restart mcp-document-processor
```

**Permission Errors:**
```bash
# Ensure proper file permissions
chmod +r /path/to/documents/*
```

**API Key Issues:**
```bash
# Verify OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
docker-compose restart mcp-document-processor
```

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in Claude Desktop configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "etownz-grants-document-processor": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [...],
      "env": {
        "DEBUG": "true",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "verbose"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üìä Usage Analytics

Track your AI-assisted grant writing performance:

### Success Metrics
- **Speed Improvement**: Time to draft applications
- **Quality Score**: AI-assessed application quality
- **Success Rate**: Grant approval percentage
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on AI assistance

### Sample Prompts for Analytics
```
